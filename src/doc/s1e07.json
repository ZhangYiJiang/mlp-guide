	"synopsis": "A dragon has taken to a nearby cave, and his smoky breath threatens to cover Ponyville. Twilight Sparkle and her friends are tasked with removing the dragon, specifically expecting that Fluttershy's affinity with animals will be useful. However, as they make the trek up the mountain, Fluttershy reveals her paralyzing fear of dragons, making the journey difficult for the others. At the cave, Fluttershy refuses to enter, and the others try their own means to evict the dragon, but they end up getting knocked against a rock. Fluttershy becomes enraged and scolds the dragon for hurting her friends, causing the dragon to cower and cry. Fluttershy is able to ask the dragon to leave of his own accord, leaving Ponyville smoke-free. "
